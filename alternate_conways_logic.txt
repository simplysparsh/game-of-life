1. For each cell:
	- count the total number of live neighbors 
	- check for game rules for that cell
	- if it is going to be dead, add in array ‘next_round_dead_cell’
	- if it is going to be dead, add in array ‘next_round_live_cell’
	- kill each cell from array ‘next_round_dead_cell’ 
	- revive each cell from array ‘next_round_live_cell’
Alliter

-get all live cells 
-get each of their dead neighbors in an array
-check for the rules of games for these dead neighbors and save the ones to be given life in next round in an array
- check for the rules of game for the live cells and proceed like previous one.

Benefits - we are not counting neighbors for each cell. Simply checking all cells if they are alive. And them counting neighbors of live cells and the dead cells around those live cells.
